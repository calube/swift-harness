# Captures where each `gesture` `kind: swipe` preset moves a finger, on a screen whose drag
# recognizer covers it whole, and a preset swipe over a recognizer that covers only a top band.
# It also captures a swipe step with no preset, with a `direction` key, and with an unknown preset.
# Usage, from anywhere: capture.sh
# It compiles SwipeProbe.swift for the simulator, then creates, boots and deletes its own
# throwaway device, so a device another session or tool is using is never touched.
